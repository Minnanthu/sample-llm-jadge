    "source_text": "Annual Environmental Impact Report 2024\n\nCarbon Emissions: Our total carbon emissions decreased by 12% year-over-year to 45,000 metric tons CO2e. Scope 1 emissions were 15,000 tons, Scope 2 were 20,000 tons, and Scope 3 were 10,000 tons. The reduction was primarily driven by our transition to renewable energy sources at three manufacturing facilities.\n\nWater Usage: Total water consumption was 2.3 million gallons, a 5% increase due to expansion of our Singapore facility. We recycled 68% of water used in manufacturing processes.\n\nWaste Management: We diverted 82% of waste from landfills through recycling and composting programs. Hazardous waste generation decreased by 18% to 120 tons.",
