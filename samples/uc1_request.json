    "source_text": "The global semiconductor shortage that began in 2020 has significantly impacted the automotive industry. Major automakers including Toyota, Ford, and General Motors were forced to reduce production, with some plants shutting down temporarily. The shortage was caused by a combination of factors: increased demand for consumer electronics during the pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the long lead times required to build new fabrication facilities. Industry analysts estimate that the shortage cost automakers approximately $210 billion in lost revenue in 2021 alone. In response, several major automakers have begun investing directly in semiconductor manufacturing partnerships to secure their supply chains.",
